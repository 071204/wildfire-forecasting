# Forecasting Wildfire Danger Using Deep Learning

The current Global ECMWF Fire Forecasting (GEFF) is based on empirical models implemented in FORTRAN several decades back. To take advantage of developments in GIS & Machine Learning and increase forecasting coverage, these models need to be adopted to Deep Learning based prediction techniques. 

The project intends to reproduce the Fire Forecasting capabilities of GEFF using Deep Learning and develop further improvements in accuracy, geography and time scale through inclusion of additional variables or optimisation of model architecture & hyperparameters. Finally, a preliminary fire spread prediction tool is proposed to allow monitoring activities.
